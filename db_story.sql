His wife Molly was a novelist, and the fact that she had posteriorly lost her sight was the beginning of all. Having become a blind woman, Molly had fallen into deep depression for being unable to write novels, which she had made into the meaning of her life, growing weaker with each passing day.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Not standing to bear witness to it, what Professor Orland did was build an Auto-Memories Doll.

The town was situated at the base of tall mountains. It represented the entire territory. However, amongst people of supple wealth, Roswell&rsquo;s name was known for its summer refuges &ndash; in other words, its villas.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">In spring, the landscape would overflow with flowers and entertain people&rsquo;s eyes; in summer, many would seek rest in an enormous waterfall that had long-standing history as a famous spot; in autumn, the rain of decaying leaves would strike everyone&rsquo;s hearts; and winter would grant a quietude that caused the whole place to become dead-silent. As the change of periods was very easily distinguishable, the land had more than enough to divert the eyes of those who visited during any season for sightseeing.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">The villas were built linked to the mountain-foot town. Those were wooden cottages painted in a variety of colors. From the smallest to the biggest lots, the cost of property in the area was quite a large sum, so having a villa made there was a proof of wealth in itself.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">The town was filled with shops for tourists. On weekends, the main street with rows of stores would be crowded, pleasant tunes playing in the background. With such assortment of goods, no one could make fun of the place just for it being in the countryside.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Most people would build villas in town for the sake of convenience, and anyone who constructed their home anywhere else was treated as an oddball.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">The current season was an autumn of cirrocumulus clouds drifting high in the sky. Away from the mountain-foot town, located near a small lake that was not greatly regarded amongst the town&rsquo;s touristic attractions, there sat an inconspicuous lone cottage.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">On the bright side, it was a traditional-style house with tastefulness in its refined traits. On the bad side, with an aspect of abandonment, the house was in poor condition. Beyond its arch-shaped gate of washed-out white paint was the panoramic view of a garden overtaken by weeds and nameless flowers. The rotting red brick walls did not seem like they would ever be repaired. Roof tiles cracked here and there, probably using to be aligned perfectly in the past but having become atrociously chipped.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Next to the house&rsquo;s entrance was a swing covered in entangled ivies, which no one could make move anymore. It was a clue that there used to be a child around, and that there was not anymore.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">The house&rsquo;s owner was a middle-aged man named Oscar. With said name, he worked in the writing industry as a playwright. He was a quirky redhead who wore heavy-lensed black-rimmed glasses. He was baby-faced, which made him look younger than his actual age, and a little bent forward. Due to cold sensitivity, he always wore a sweater. He was a completely normal man that did not hint he could become a protagonist in any sort of story.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Oscar had the house built not as a villa, but with the genuine desire to spend his life there. Not him alone, but also his wife and young daughter. It had enough space for the three of them, yet no one but Oscar lived there. The other two had already passed away.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">The cause of death of Oscar&rsquo;s wife had been a disease. Its name was too lengthy, to the point of being unpronounceable. Simply put, it consisted of the clotting of blood inside the vessels and death by clogging. Moreover, it was hereditary, and his wife had inherited it from her father.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">As she had become an orphan due to the high rate of early deaths in her family, he had only come to find out the harsh truth regarding his wife, who had been solitary from her lack of relatives, after she was gone.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><em>&ldquo;She was afraid that, if you&rsquo;d known, you might have not wanted to marry a sick woman, so she kept it a secret.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>The one who had told him so had been her best friend.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">From the moment he received the revelation at her funeral, one question had constantly echoed in Oscar&rsquo;s head:&nbsp;&ldquo;Why? Why? Why?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><em>――</em><em>If only</em><em>&hellip;</em><em>&nbsp;she had told me about that, no matter how much it cost</em><em>&hellip;</em><em>&nbsp;we could have searched for a cure together, or invested in it any amount of the money that we had uselessly piled up.</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">It was glaringly obvious that Oscar&rsquo;s wife had not married him for gold digging. He had met her before becoming a playwright, the place of their encounter had been a library that he frequently visited, and the one who had first noticed her &ndash; the librarian &ndash; was Oscar himself.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><em>――</em><em>I thought she was</em><em>&hellip;</em><em>&nbsp;a beautiful person. The corner of new books she was in charge of was always interesting. While I fell in love with those books, I also fell in love with her.</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;had bounced around several hundreds of million times within his head, then disappeared.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">His wife&rsquo;s best friend was a responsible person, and as he had lost spirit with his wife&rsquo;s death, the latter had energetically put herself in motion to take care of him and the daughter he had been left with. She would prepare warm meals for Oscar, who would not even eat all day if left alone, and braid the hair of the little girl who cried and mourned the absence of the mother that used to do so.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Perhaps there had been a bit of one-sided love involved. One time, as his daughter had lay in bed with a fever and suddenly started to vomit repeatedly, the one who had taken her to the hospital had been the friend. The one who had found out first that the girl had the same disease as her mother had not been her father, but her mother&rsquo;s best friend.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">What occurred afterwards had progressed slowly, but in Oscar&rsquo;s eyes, it had been much too fast.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">So as to not let his wife&rsquo;s case happen all over again, he had relied on several renowned doctors. From one prominent hospital to another, they had bowed their heads to many people, asking for help and gathering information for testing new drugs.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Medicines and side effects were two faces of the same coin. His daughter would wail every time she took them. The nursing days where he had been unable to take his eyes off the suffering of his loved one had gnawed his heart, well acquainted with them as he was.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">No matter what kind of new remedies they tried, the condition of his daughter&rsquo;s disease had not improved. Eventually, they had run out even of what to depend on, and the medics had given up as well, declaring her as incurable.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">&ldquo;I wonder if my wife is beckoning her to the underworld because she&rsquo;s lonely&hellip;&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em>As he later recalled, he had pondered about foolish things like that again and again.&nbsp;Even as he had supplicated, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t take her with you&rdquo; to his wife&rsquo;s grave, the dead do not have mouths to reply.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Oscar had been mentally cornered, yet the one that had broken down faster was his wife&rsquo;s best friend, who had followed them through the hospitals until then. Overwrought from watching over his unstable daughter, before anyone noticed, she had distanced herself from the hospital until, finally, Oscar and his daughter had been truly left on their own.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Due to a daily routine of over-prescriptions, his daughter&rsquo;s cheeks, which had previously resembled rose petals floating on white milk, had become profoundly yellowish and she had grown hideously puny due to weight loss. Her hair that used to smell sweet and look like honey had quickly fallen off.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Seeing it had been unbearable. Hers was truly an appearance he had been unable to endure looking at.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">At last, as the outcome of him having repeated a fruitless back-and-forth argument with the doctors, they had settled for administrating nothing but painkillers to his daughter. He had not wanted the rest of her already short life to be engrossed in affliction.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">From then on, there had been a touch of peace. Easygoing days. Watching his daughter&rsquo;s smile for the first time in a while.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">Their remaining few days of happiness had continued.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">The weather had been wonderful the day she passed away.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">It was an autumn where the surroundings had lost its colors moment by moment. The sky had been clear. Red and yellow-dyed trees could be seen from the hospital&rsquo;s windows as well.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Within the hospital&rsquo;s vicinity, there was a fountain built as a spot for relaxation, and decayed leaves had been drifting onto the water&rsquo;s surface, navigating quietly. The leaves would fall, buoy and wander over the water, accumulating as though pulled by a magnet. They were remnants that had become even more beautiful despite losing their life. His daughter had talked about how &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; they were.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;The blue of the water mixing with the yellow of the leaves is very pretty. Hey, if I were on top of those leaves, I wonder if I could walk over the fountain without falling.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Such a child-like conception. In truth, the leaves would give to gravity and her weight, and her body would soon sink into the water.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Not rebuffing her, Oscar had jokingly replied, &ldquo;If you had an umbrella and used the wind, you&rsquo;d have even more chances of making it work, huh?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">He had wished to spoil that child who no longer could be saved, even if just a little.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Hearing his response, his daughter had smiled with twinkling eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show it to you one day, okay? On that lake close to our house. During the time in autumn when the fallen leaves drift about the water surface. One day.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">One day, she would show it to him.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Later on, after multiple coughs, his daughter had abruptly passed away. She was still only nine years old.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Her lifeless body had been light as he embraced it. Even while lacking a soul, it had been much too light. Shedding tears, Oscar had wondered if she had truly ever been alive or if he had merely been having a long-lasting dream.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">He had buried his daughter in the same cemetery as his wife, and then returned to the place that used to be a home for the three of them, resuming his life reticently. Oscar had enough economic power to lead life without doing anything &ndash; the scripts he had written were used everywhere and, in turn, he counted with a system where money would come his way from deposit transfer payments, so he could not die from starvation due to his savings running out.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">After years of mourning his daughter and wife, he was approached by an old companion from his former job with the proposal of writing a screenplay again. The task was from an elite troupe admired by anyone who worked with theatre, and for Oscar, who only had his name left in the industry and had been attempting to erase his existence, such a job was an honor.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">His days were nothing but indolent, dissolute and grief-indulged. Humans are creatures that grow weary of things, unable to stay sad or happy forever. Such is their nature.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar had accepted the offer with a two-worded reply, deciding to hold onto a pen once more. However, it was from then that trouble began.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">For the sake of escaping from the harsh reality, Oscar had turned into quite a drinker. It had also served as a bit of a medicine for him to have good dreams when he smoked. He had managed to overcome the alcohol and drugs thanks to the assistance of doctors, but was left with a tremor in his hands. Be it on paper or with a typewriter, he had been simply unable to progress soundly with his writing. Only the desire to write had properly remained in his chest.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">All he had to do was find a means to put it into words.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">As he asked for advice from the work colleague who had made him the writing proposal, the latter had told him,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something nice for you. You should use an Auto-Memories Doll.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so disconnected from the ways of the world&hellip; More like your alienation from it is at a worrisome level. They&rsquo;re popular. Nowadays, you can commission them for a considerably low price. That&rsquo;s right; let&rsquo;s request one to test it out.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;A doll&hellip; could help me?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;A special one can.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar then decided to use the tool of which only name had entered his ears. An &ldquo;Auto-Memories Doll&rdquo;.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">His encounter with her started from there.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">A woman climbed up the mountain road. Dark red ribbons decorated her soft braided hairdo, her slim body enveloped in a snow-white ribbon-tie one-piece dress. Her skirt of silk pleats swayed gracefully as she walked, the emerald brooch on her chest glittering in sparkles. The jacket she wore over her dress was of a Prussian blue that braced the white. Her long boots, worn on long term, were made of leather that emanated a deep cocoa-brown hue. With a heavy-looking trolley bag in hand, she made her way through the white arch gate of Oscar&rsquo;s house and moved forward.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Just as she stepped into the residence&rsquo;s front yard, a gust of autumn wind blew by noisily. Red, yellow and brown decayed leaves floated about as if dancing, revolving around the woman. Perhaps due to the debris of leaves in fall colors casting a curtain over her eyes, her field of vision was lost.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">The woman firmly gripped the brooch on her chest. She muttered something lowly, and as her voice was quieter than the rustling of the decayed leaves, it melted into the air without reverberating or anyone being able to hear it.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Once the mischievous wind settled down, the woman&rsquo;s earlier atmosphere of caution was left behind somewhere and, upon reaching the front entrance, without any particular aspect of hesitation, she pressed the house&rsquo;s buzzer with a finger covered in a black glove. The grating sound of the buzzer echoed like a scream from hell, and after a short while, the door opened. The house&rsquo;s owner &ndash; the redhead Oscar &ndash; revealed himself. Perhaps he had just woken up or not slept, but his garments and face were unbecoming to welcome a visitor either way.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">As Oscar looked at the woman, he had on a slightly perplexed expression. Was it because the outfit she wore was much too strange? Or was it because she was so very stunning?</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Whichever it was, he dry-swallowed for an instant. &ldquo;Are you&hellip; the Auto-Memories Doll?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">&ldquo;Precisely. I rush to wherever my customers might desire. I am from the Auto-Memories Dolls service, Violet Evergarden,&rdquo; the blonde, blue-eyed woman who possessed a beauty that seemed to have jumped out of a fairytale answered with a clear voice, not putting on a fake smile.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">The woman named Violet Evergarden had an appearance as fine-looking and reticent as an actual doll. Framed by golden lashes, her blue irises had a gleam like the bottom of the ocean, with cherry-pink cheeks over milky white skin and bewitchingly lustrous rouge lips. She was a woman of a beauty akin to the Full Moon, not at all lacking in anything anywhere. Were it not for her blinking, she would turn into a mere object of appreciation.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar had absolutely no knowledge regarding Auto-Memories Dolls, and so had asked the friend who made his job request to arrange her for him.&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sent there in a few days,&rdquo;&nbsp;was what he had been told, and after he did his waiting, he was at last visited by her.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><em>――</em><em>I was totally thinking that the postman would bring me a tiny robotic doll in a package.</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">By no means had he imagined that it would be an android so similar to a human.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><em>――</em><em>Just how much has civilization evolved while I was secluding myself?</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar had a character ignorant of the world in general. He read neither newspapers nor magazines and had scarce social disposition. If he did not have friends who concerned themselves with him, the people he would see would likely be limited to the deliveryman who provided to him from the grocery store.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">He soon regretted the fact that it would have been better to ask for the arrangement after doing a more proper research. To have a person other than himself&hellip; or something resembling a human being in a house meant for three gave him an awful sense of discomfort, and somehow caused him to remember things that carried a bitter aftertaste.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><em>――</em><em>Feels like I&rsquo;m doing something terrible to my family&hellip;</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Having no idea about such thoughts of Oscar&rsquo;s, Violet sat on the couch of the living room that she had been led to. She neatly sipped away her black tea upon being offered, so it would seem that machines had been developing considerably as of late.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;What happens to the black tea you just drank?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Sensing it as a question, Violet answered, &ldquo;It will eventually be discharged from my body&hellip; and return to the earth?&rdquo; while tilting her head a little. It was a mechanic doll-like response.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;To be honest&hellip; I&rsquo;m confused. Hum, because you&rsquo;re a bit different&hellip; from what I&rsquo;d pictured.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Violet examined her own attire with a glance and then looked back at Oscar, who stared at her while remaining on his feet rather than sitting on a chair with her. &ldquo;Is there any point that was not in accordance with your hopes?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;No&hellip; rather than &lsquo;hopes&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;If Master would not mind waiting, I could request our company to send a doll other than myself.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;No&hellip; that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to say&hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s okay&hellip; As long as you can do the work, that&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t seem like a loud one.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;If you so order, I could also breathe as thinly as possible.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have&hellip; to go that far.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;I have come here because you, Master, sought for ghostwriting. I shall work to please you so as not to taint the name of Auto-Memories Dolls. I do not mind whether the tools at my disposition are pen and paper or a typewriter. Please do use me as you plan to.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">As she said so with her large gem-like blue orbs gazing at him fixatedly, Oscar nodded with an &ldquo;okay&rdquo;, his heart racing a little.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">The period he had borrowed her for was of two weeks. In that meantime, they had to finish a story no matter what. Oscar switched his feelings over, showing her to his study and starting work immediately. Or so he claimed, yet what Violet ended up doing first was not ghostwriting but cleaning said study.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar&rsquo;s room, which was an integrated study and bedroom, was in a disastrous state where the clothes that he had stripped off and a pan with not entirely eaten food adhered to it had been left all over the floor. Simply put, there was no space for even one foot to step inside.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Violet looked at him silently with her blue orbs. &ldquo;You called me here and yet what&rsquo;s this situation?&rdquo; her eyes seemed to say.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">It was certainly not the room of a working person. He hardly used the living room after having become alone, which was why it was clean, but the bedroom, kitchen, toilet and bathroom that he frequently entered and exited had fallen to an atrocious state.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">It was a good thing that Violet was an artificial doll, Oscar thought. From what he could see, her body age seemed to be from late teens to mid-twenties, and he did not want to show something so embarrassing to a woman that young. Though he was aging, it was deplorable for him as a man.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;Master, I am a ghostwriter, not a maid.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Despite saying so, she pulled a frilly white apron out of the bag she had brought along and willingly tidied everything up. The first day ended with that.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">On the second day, the two of them settled in the study and started their work one way or another. Oscar lay on his bed while Violet sat on a chair, her hands atop the typewriter on his desk.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;&lsquo;She&hellip; said&rsquo;,&rdquo; Oscar spoke, and she quietly wrote down each letter with terrifying speed in blind touch. Turning his eyes toward it, he was astonished. &ldquo;Pretty fast, huh.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">As he gave the compliment, Violet removed one of the black gloves that overtook the sleeves of her clothes and displayed one of her arms. It was metallic. The fingertips had a constitution even harder and more robot-like than the other parts of her. The coating of paint on the joints in-between a finger and another was also insufficient.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;I utilize a brand that employs pragmatism. This is the standard of the Estark Company, so my endurance rates are high, and it is possible for me to perform movements and use a level of physical force that the human body would not be able to, which makes these into rather extraordinary products. I shall register Master&rsquo;s words without omissions.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">&ldquo;Is that so&hellip;? Ah, hey, you don&rsquo;t have to write down what I said now. Just the words for the script.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar continued to dictate. They took many breaks in the process, but things went well for the starting day. He had the story&rsquo;s concept inside him to begin with. He did not get stuck with the text too often.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">While speaking, Oscar realized that Violet was an excellent listener and ghostwriter. She had given off an impression of serenity from the start, and it showed vividly when she entered work mode. Although he had not ordered her to, he really could not hear the sound of her breathing. All he picked on was the clacking noise that her typing produced. He could even feel as if he was the one using the typewriter if he closed his eyes. Whenever he asked until what point she had written, it was fun to have her read it out to him, for her voice was temperate and her reciting skillful.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Any text seemed like a solemn fictional story if she was the one narrating.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\"><em>――</em><em>I see; of course these would turn out popular.</em></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">Oscar was able to learn the greatness of Auto-Memories Dolls keenly. Yet though things went smoothly until the third day, a period of being unable to write anything persisted from the fourth day on. It was something common amongst writers. There were times when one could not properly come up with words despite having already decided on the contents to be written.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">From his many years of experience, Oscar knew of a coping method for whenever he was not able to write. That was to avoid writing. He had internalized a rule that nothing he managed to write through forcing himself was remarkable.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#666666\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Libre Franklin&quot;,sans-serif\">He felt sorry for Violet, but had to leave her in waiting. Left with nothing to do, she expressionlessly took care of the cleaning and cooking once requested to.

Unfortunately, each and every region has a calendar of their own, a language of their own and a culture of their&#39;s own and given the lack of innovation in the scientific areas regarding dates and times, it posses a great setback to recording capabilities of the Church and all other big power factions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to combat that situation of inability, a new system of calendar was made by the Central Church which was made compulsory to every single ruling body of the Central Continent. It was a basic type of map by which the year is divided into 12 seasons, instead of months. The number of days in these seasons changes every year depending on the climatic conditions. Generally, no such demarcations are made in the calendar for the season and the seasons all depend on the current climatic condition of the Kingdom of Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1 A Short Summary of All Previous Incident&ndash; 1</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Felix&#39;s POV<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverything started with the 36th Grand Crusade War of XX56 of the Catholic Calendar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat is a Crusade War?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is nothing but a sport which the higher ups of the Central Continent of Audenia play with those of the Southern Continent on their 100-year birthdays or something or whenever they are bored. The higher-ups here generally mean the Catholic Church of the Central Continent and the 9 Monarchial States behind it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the opponent side, there is the Grand Caliphate, the Empire of the 7 Rivers, or better known as the Coalition State of Sindhu, the Kingdoms of Sands and the Confederate of Sultanate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsually, these big wars would be bedtime stories for children like me with mothers talking about how heroic knights are, how zealous the priests of the Church are and how everyone unites for a shared cause. But this time, it was different for me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause, this time, it was my own father who participated in this war and died in it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy father left with his puny army of 2000 veteran Cainhorn Cavalry to the ports of Darwin and Saltmoore. From there, he and his men travelled for two whole months before landing on the shores of the Southern Continent. And that was the last I heard of him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe war raged on for a good 5 years and in these years, I neither saw or heard anything of my father. Nothing. Not even a snippet of news.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI lived in my home, the Cainhorn Castle with my mother and my blood brother Aslak Emory, son of Julian Emory, constantly in fear of the unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to keep us healthy and sound minded, my Master, Sir Loann Archibald, made me and my brother Aslak train like hell. In the 5 years, we were introduced to the family heirloom Battle Technique, the Black Wolf Technique. We practiced day and night, not leaving a single moment without my sword and armor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith passing time, we matured. Very quickly and before we knew it, we had already shed every bit of childishness from our souls. At the age of 9, I was rewarded my own set of knight armor, a black Warden Knight set and it was also then that I killed my first monstrous beast. A Grade-1 Thunder Cougar. While Aslak was a little bit unlucky and had to wait for another two days before he was able to slay his first beast, a Bloated Man, a mid Grade-1 humanoid monster with a bloated body and long arms with long claws. It was a better kill than my Thunder Cougar and that enraged me. And thus, started a competition between us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe competition kept us occupied for a good while but then news came that the Crusade War is over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho won it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there&#39;s no wining in a Crusade War. There&#39;s only a tally of losses. How much did which side lose? How much changes did this war create? How will the economy be affected?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are the topics which are discussed. Not &#39;Who won the war?&#39; or &#39;How many people died?&#39;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNobody gives a squat on how many people died! Nobody cares how many women became widows! Nobody cares about how many children became orphans! No one bloody cares!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there was one solid rumor after the battle was over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&#39;The Wolf of Cainhorn died in the battle&#39;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &#39;Wolf of Cainhorn&#39;? Who is the &#39;Wolf of Cainhorn&#39;? Is it the same Cainhorn as my home? Was the Wolf &hellip; my father&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI never believed those rumors when I heard it. Neither did my mother or brother or anyone in the Castle. How could a great and charismatic leader like my father die so easily!! Not to mention my uncle, Julian Emory was there with him, the most careful and cautious person when it comes to his and my father&#39;s life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI never believed it until the Cainhorn ships which left for the Crusade Wars returned back. Carrying my father&#39;s casket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI never believed it even when I saw my father&#39;s pale face. Not even when Sir Celyn Prothero told me the fact. Not even when the archbishop of Xerith assured me. Even still&hellip; I feel like it was all a prank. A prank by the Gods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI cried for days and was depressed for weeks. The first few days I never ate anything and for the next few months, I didn&#39;t talk to anyone, not even with my brother. A silent hatred sprouted in my heart. A hatred with no definition. A wrath with no bounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I buried it inside and never showed it to anyone, not even to Aslak or my closest associate, Mallus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMallus was a kid the same age as me, who was introduced to me by Kadec when I was depressed and wasn&#39;t talking with anyone. I hated Kadec and Mallus at first because the reason Kadec gave me and everyone for letting Mallus follow me was for &#39;curing&#39; me of depression. But as time passed, my hatred for Mallus decreased as he was, in truth, very loyal. Someone I wanted to mold into my own preference. Evil, right? Haha! 6 years ago, there was enough evil in me to drown an entire country in eternal darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut fortunately, nothing like that happened. At least not for a year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe year of my 10th birthday was a blissful year. Remember I said that the ship came back carrying the coffin of my father. Guess what, the ship didn&#39;t only contain the casket of my father but along with it, there was various spoils of war like Gold, jewelry, diamonds, slaves, exotic timber and so many more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd along with it, it also brought home a cursed crown and two new step-mothers for me. Pregnant step-mothers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, that is true.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, as it happens to be, my father was a real super hero in the Crusade War and some cunning rulers of those lands, probably, in order to secure a non-death future for themselves, had their daughters married to my father. A political marriage of sorts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApparently, after defeating the Satavahana Kingdom of Western Sindhu and successfully laying siege of its capital of Indu, the then King of Satavahana granted his daughter Aarti to my father who became my first step-mother. Along with that, he also paid 1 million Golds as a dowry to him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy second step-mother is Lady Yasmina, the Princess of the Kingdom of Salem, a kingdom famous around the world for their assassins. The siege of Salem by my father was a strategic victory against the Sultanate and the Caliphate and just like the King of Satavahana, the King of Salem to handed his daughter to my father. But unlike most time, it seems that my father knew the Princess long before they married and I also heard rumors that they had quite a fruitful romance before they even married.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut none of that matters now because my father is already dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut before he died, he did manage to get them pregnant, though. Which left me with three new siblings&hellip;. Hah! As if Aslak wasn&#39;t enough for me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe eldest of the three siblings was Jasmine, daughter of Lady Yasmina. After her were the twins of Lady Aarti, Asha and Arvind. These three added on my pain and suffering and made my life a living hell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt first, the three would squeak and cry like any normal infants but from the age of two, they started showing strange traits. Jasmine, the eldest of all, showed a great bookworm character, just like me and would stay all day in the Keep Library without paying a single heed to the words and advice of playing outside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe turned out to be very much like her mother, her skin was pale, her hair was completely black which she always tied in a long ponytail, draping over her shoulders like a curtain and each and every movement she made had grace in it, as if she wasn&#39;t a two-years old but a 20-year old Lady. And she was very skinny but that definitely didn&#39;t mean that she was weak. She was hella strong and her pinches are one of the most destructive weapons in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter her is Asha. She is the energetic creature of all the three, running around the Castle all day long and breaking things as and when she liked. She had her mother&#39;s temper, my father&#39;s face and with a child&#39;s innocence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer brother, Arvind, on the otherhand was a two-goody-shoe with a timid personality. Both of them had chocolate brown skin, large brown eyes and quite healthy limbs. In terms of talents, all three of them were quite good, definitely a lot better than me, but only Asha was interested in participating in any kind of training.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then, there are their mothers. Lady Yasmina and Lady Aarti. Both of them were quite a surprise not only to me but to all the people of Cainshire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLady Aarti of Satavahana is a Lady of about late-twenties with a large stature. She didn&#39;t have broad shoulders or anything, but her body was muscled evenly throughout. She had an oval-shaped face, large black eyes and short hair which she always tied in a ponytail. As for her body&hellip;. Ahem! She had a great bosom and a large &hellip; bottom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomething which can make any man swoon over her but if any dared to go ten feet near her with those thoughts, only Gods knows what kind of torture than man is going to experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for Lady Yasmina, she too is young, her age somewhere in the thirties but by face, she would look just like a lady in her early twenties. She has pale skin, large hazel eyes, a long nose bridge and very thin rosy lips. Unlike Mother Aarti she didn&#39;t have much of a figure but there was a different kind of charm to herself entirely. She would always wear black clothes with a black veil covering her face, something which is in her religion but none of that is able to hide her beauty and charm. She is very calculative and cunning and she herself leads a small army of 150 slaves, who are infact, the famed Nizari Hassassins from her kingdom of Salem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut unlike what one would think, neither she nor Mother Aarti tried to vie for the throne of Cainshire. Instead, they helped my mother at adapting to her new role. Mother Yasmina took the big job of managing all the finance accounts of the Castle while Mother Aarti took the role of disciplining the Cainhorn army and training the new recruits along with Loann and the other commanders. They became the pillars of the Castle and the earldom of Cainhorn. And not only that, both of them even helped me to get over my depression.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring that time, something else happened too. The spoils of war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike I mentioned before, the ships returned with the spoils of war which started from simple Gold coins to exotic timber to slaves and so many things. The total amount of the material spoils, everything leaving living beings, amounted to 2.5 million Golds. It was a huge amount even at the level of the kingdoms. Just the spoils were enough to overflow the treasury of the Castle and my mother feared that having so much Gold would be disastrous for the earldom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, she along with Mother Yasmin and Mother Aarti and various other advisors met and decided to spend the money as quickly as they could. They decided to spend a huge amount on upgrading the naval and trade power of Cainhorn and therefore decided to upgrade the docks and the navy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEveryone unanimously decided to buy a Grade-3 Man&#39;O&#39;War from the Presley Kingdom, the kingdom of Lord Hendrickson and to make a pact with Crest faction and to do trade with them. They figured that with the incoming succession war of the Xerith empire, the Crest faction would be a good both as a trade partner and an ally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut we were all wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __X<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor&#39;s Note : Hello guys!!

Anyway...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the story, like you guessed, I&#39;ve not been able to make the auxiliary chapters in time and I&#39;m in quite a dilemma on whether or not should I give the entire setting of Sir Aston&#39;s Crusade Campaign because it contains a lot of crucial information and secrets which are best to leave for the latter part.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, instead of making a dozen or so chapters, I will make two chapter(this is one and the second will come tomorrow) which will deal with a few of the incidents in the previous plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, MIND YOU, the starting plot and background of the story is a bit different as I&#39;ve included a lot of new characters and things which were not included in the previous story. Now, this will make you feel a little confused and that&#39;s why don&#39;t be shy to hit a question in the COMMENT&#39;S SECTION. I will try to clear as much of your doubts as much as I can without revealing too much of the story. Some of your doubts may also be cleared in the following chapters so I will kindly skip on those but don&#39;t worry, it is well-explained.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond of all, the plot of the story will be a little different. Like I previously mentioned in the Announcement chapter, many of the aspects of the story will be different.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of which are, a different, more fluid and lord-like character of Felix, a new completely new area of exploration, The Abyss (I previously thought of including it at a later stage but in the new draft, I will be including it early and it will be the first &#39;cheat&#39; of Felix, not cheat like a cheat, more like a opportunity), more vibrant characters and logical thinking and dialogue, a more refined Cultivation System for the Lords, Cultivators and Mages, a more refined and accurate medieval setting, accurate combat style and World-Building. In additional to all of that, I will be including a romance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, in the genre of romance, I&#39;m completely blind. I received some sensible, lord-like suggestion and some quite nice scenarios but currently I&#39;m again in a paradox of whether doing it or not. Personally, I&#39;m a fan of mutual-love between a couple and not harem(because they are only good for fap material, sorry to all harem-lovers) but a lord without a harem is no lord at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, it is not decided, so it might take a while(but not too much) for the romance to appear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, if you spot any error, typos, grammar mistakes or sentencing error, please hit me up. Btw, I&#39;m trying to make a discord server but I clearly don&#39;t know how. Any suggestion or experts in that field, please hit me up and help me to get that thing on. Because with it on, I will be able to upload a lot of the artwork from where I get my ideas from. Maybe it might even help you to start your own work and I will definitely be happy for you. So, please help me!! See ya!</p>', 0, 2234, 1, '2021-04-25 08:25:00', '2021-04-25 08:25:00'),
(16159, 'A Short Summary', 'Chapter 2', 'chapter-2', '<h2>2 A Short Summary &ndash; 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We were fools to trust Hendrickson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComplete fools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe conveyed our wish to merge with the Presley kingdom and the Crest faction. They agreed almost instantly and even sent one of their Grade-3 Man&#39;O&#39;War, Carnage, as a gift and even added an extra 10,000 cannon balls and its ammunition, 2000 mortar shots, 1000 muskets and 10,000 musket roundshot ammunition and even agreed to send 3 more Grade-3 Man&#39;O&#39;War ships after the completion of the merging. Their generosity baffled us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe thought that they were sincere but our world was turned upside down when my mother along with Julian and some veterans visited the Pristine Palace of the Presley kingdom, the palace where Hendrickson welcomed her. The signing of the Non-Aggression Pact was supposed to be over in a week or so and she was supposed to return in a month. But she didn&#39;t. And neither did her retinue of advisor or any soldier who accompanied her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPanic engulfed us as reports came from all over said that the Cainhorn army had plundered regional villages and ransacked the City of Fairiron, the main City of the fiefdom of Viscount Clovers, a member of the Crest faction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbsurd, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin days, Presley navy blocked all the naval points of Cainhorn and demanded an explanation for violation of the Pact of Aggression. But tell me, what kind of explanation can we give when we don&#39;t even know what the f*ck was happening?!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd thus, with no solid proof of our innocence (here, proof means a witness or a reliable evidence like the &#39;words&#39; of a prominent Lord like Hendrickson or even Clovers, though, both of them were the main culprit and therefore we, technically, didn&#39;t have a single proof) and with the Council of Advisors constant pleas to make conversation, the temporary head of the family, Loann, agreed to talk with Hendrickson, the spokesman of the Crest faction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the 15th of Month of Winds (July), the bilateral talks between Hendrickson and the Cainshiren higher ups started and surprisingly, it didn&#39;t even last for a single hour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy did it end so quickly? Because the terms were unreasonable. No! The terms were outright blasphemous!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey wanted us to do a complete merging with the Presley kingdom and also offered us some lucrative terms like granting us 3 Grade-2 Man&#39;O&#39;War and a large chunk of the prosperous Grey River inland trade routes but in return they wanted &hellip; they wanted my mother to marry his youngest son, Alexander Hendrickson. A man who was not only a decade younger than her but he also had a tremendously bad reputation in the capital for being a womanizer and torturer of women. Yes, torturer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat was completely unacceptable by Loann and everyone else on the bilateral table. Wait! There was more to their terms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey wanted Mother Yasmina and Mother Aarti to renounce their titles and statuses as my father&#39;s mistresses and to leave the Dean household immediately and also wanted the household to denounce me as my mother&#39;s son, thus not only gaining the control of the Cainhorn Castle position but also perfectly cutting the Dean bloodline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut none of that was acceptable. And so, we declined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey counterattacked by threatening the life of my mother. And the worst part was that we couldn&#39;t even do anything. It was the hard truth that they had all the leverages and we couldn&#39;t even make a peep. It was a total humiliation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRiots broke out in the streets of Cainshire and trade was being hit harder than ever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe waited for a few days, hoping that Hendrickson would take back his first proposal and propose something better, something which we could actually agree on but no!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat bloody bastard!!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey kept mum!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey didn&#39;t change their proposal for a long time but right when we were on the verge of going into war with the Crest faction, they changed their decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey agreed to release my mother on a remuneration of 1 million Golds to the Crest faction and by leashing the town of Cainshire to the Hendrickson for a period of 2 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt seemed reasonable at least but wait! A few weeks after, a check of an additional 1 million Golds came. What was that for, we thought. Well, according to them, gifts are gifts when they are friends and not enemies. Remember Carnage, the ship they sent as gift. They wanted a pay of 1 million Gold for it. Shameless!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe agreed to each and every single bit of their terms because to us, nothing mattered other than the well being of my mother.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn 26th of the Month of Winds, the representatives of Cainshire which included Loann, Mother Yasmina and Sir Alfred Calmette, the navy admiral of the Cainhorn Navy met with the representatives of the Presley kingdom and the Crest faction which mainly included Gwydion Hendrickson, the King of the Presley kingdom and Imperial Prince Leon Crest of the Crest faction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new pact of Non-Aggression was signed which successfully transferred the authority of Cainshire to Colonel Reggie, Gwydion Hendrickson&#39;s spokesman of Cainshire and the transfer of 1 million Golds to the Crest faction and an additional 1 million to Presley kingdom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe consequences of this Pact were tremendous and completely unforeseen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Colonel Reggie and his regiment the Varshney division came into the town, the town was turned upside down. He immediately set the trade tax to 60% and the annual tax of each household to 300 Silvers, which is an absurd price in any place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to that, he disbanded the Town Hall and persecuted nearly all the elders of the Town Hall because they &#39;thought&#39; that these elders might stage some kind of rebellion in the town.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey also flowed too much of Presley products in the Cainshire markets and completely crippled the market. Along with that, they made some absurd rules like the water tax, the steel tax and the Ruler&#39;s Authority Tax. What are they?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe water tax is the tax which is levied on every living being of Cainshire, where they be animals or humans, to pay a certain amount of tax for using any water in any kind of work. The place of the water didn&#39;t matter as there was a fixed 20 Coppers weekly per head for drinking a single drop of water, or basically for being alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe steel tax is levied on any and all kind of metal work starting from simple Copper or brass to steel or even rare titanium. All were under this tax. The last of the three, the Ruler&#39;s Authority tax was the most gruesome of all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis tax made it compulsory for each and every household of Cainshire to pay a certain amount of money as a tribute to Colonel Reggie and his Varshney division as a sign of obedience. Mind you, it is NOT a protection fee. They took a separate amount for protection and this went completely separately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for those who weren&#39;t able to pay this amount were subjected to a lot of harassment like breaking down of their houses, throwing them off or even raping the women of their household. Varshney soldiers infamously called it the Weekend **** Session as there would at least a single household in a population of 20,000 who will not be able to pay this tax each week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese and along with it there were those common colonial taxes like salt tax, trade tax, timber tax, metal tax (this is different from the steel tax as the steel tax applies for only steel being regulated inside the region of Cainshire and not what is being traded) and so many more. All of these made the people of extremely poor and lose all of their savings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven traders weren&#39;t out of Colonel Reggie&#39;s harassments. Other than increasing the trade tax and the import tax, he even made some absurd rules like every woman entering the docks of the Cainshire is a slave no matter what their actual profession was. This drove away dozens of female traders who were once good partners of the Cainshiren traders and many others lost their lives here. Among the dead, there was one whose death I regretted very much&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut even with this much harassments and taxes, Colonel Reggie was still very unsatisfied both mentally and monetarily. He ordered a grand deforestation program on the Cainhorn Wilds but it went horribly bad for both the Varshney division and the people of Cainshire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe actual fact of that program is clearly unknown but what is known is very terrifying. Reports said that Colonel Reggie managed to gather a grand force of 5000 Cainshiren, 1000 Varshney soldier and hundreds of professional hunters for the project but right on the day of the project, a heavy fog and a beast tide descended on the group and devoured them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was not a single survivor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd just like that, 5000 people of 20,000 population of Cainshire disappeared. In the wake of this disaster, Colonel Reggie increased the tax to 500 Silvers per annum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd like that 2 years went away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe were finally a little relieved that the tough 2 years would pass away but&hellip; unfortunately it didn&#39;t. We thought that after the completion of the 2 years, we will get back Cainshire but we didn&#39;t. And this happened just because of my incompetency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was 12 then and by tradition, I was a grown up. I was supposed to take up my mother&#39;s side and help her in her administration process and to see Colonel Reggie out of Cainshire but I neglected that duty and let the Council of Advisors handle it. I thought that they would be like-minded men. But they were nothing but a big disappointment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy mother and the Council of Advisor proposed a new deal which let the Presley kingdom stay in control of Cainshire for an additional 3 years given that they pay a tribute to the Cainhorn Castle of 10,000 Gold yearly and on the pretext of removing all kinds of trade taxes and harassment of traders and removing all restrictions on the Cainhorn navy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey agreed immediately and thus began a new era of suffering for the people of Cainshire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe result of this new deal was much harsher than the previous one. Dozens of riots broke out in a span of two months and hundreds of Cainshiren died at the cost of only two Varshney soldier. It was a disaster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo one was happy with this new deal, not even the higher ups of the army and especially me. I staged a silent coup in the army and successfully created my own regiment of the army, the Castle Guards made up of 500 men, out of which 300 were Cavalry, my own Cavalry and the rest 200 were divided into 150 archers of Aslak and 50 naval knights. I was also successful in gaining the trust and allegiance of 50 of the Nizari Hassassins of Mother Yasmina to serve me, the best among them being Lihan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith them, I slowly rose in power in the Castle. It is true that I wasn&#39;t handed the throne of Cainshire because the throne wasn&#39;t inheritable (1) but in unofficial terms, I was the de facto ruler of the Castle beside Loann and my mother.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut on the hindsight, the new deal wasn&#39;t totally unprofitable for us. The glaring weakpoint of the deal was the allowance of the Cainhorn Navy to come into action, allowing us to exert our naval power in the Grey Canal region again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo Colonel Reggie, this move seemed risk-free but they were also foolish enough to not mention the type of unit to be allowed in these naval raids. And thus, with the help of admiral Alfred, I was successfully able to sneak sections of my regiment with the naval guards, letting them have the required real-action that one needed to become a powerful knight. And not only me, even Peder Ruen, the Garrison Commander, Pena Lanford, the Cavalry Commander and Sir Loann also started exerting their power more often. And that is how the Cainhorn army started its intensive training in secret.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe last and my least favorite event of these 5 years &hellip; is the birth of Erika.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the Second Pact of Non-Aggression was signed, we were allowed to bring mother back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut after bringing my mother back, the entirety of the Castle was shocked to find what happened to her. Apparently, instead of providing my mother with the most basic amenities that as a noble she deserved, she was mentally and physically tortured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy mother returned back pregnant and with her vitality fading. She was poisoned by a strange and new kind of poison. Her condition was so severe that when she was brought in the Castle, she was nothing more than a pile of bones, her face lost all the charm that she once possessed and the light in her eyes were fading at a rapid pace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSir Doncan, the Keep doctor, was able to stop the vitality drain to a large extent with the help of a lot of expensive drugs but he couldn&#39;t cure her. Along with the physical deterioration, there was also the mental breakdown from the torture she faced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of these factors made it impossible for Sir Doncan to go through with an abortion process to abort the unborn child. We couldn&#39;t do anything other than letting her suffer with the baby.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the baby was born, the entire Council of Advisors were in favor of killing the child. Many other conservative fellows agreed too, but who in their right mind will try to kill a day-old infant. Only insane people can do that and Cainshire had not a single of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe again didn&#39;t have a choice other than letting her live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd without a choice, I took her in. Some criticized it, some outright objected to it but letting an infant die, even if it is of some unknown man &hellip; is something which my heart won&#39;t allow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn my honor, I pledged to bring that girl up because in my heart, she&#39;s born in the Dean household and as a Dean she shall live her entire life. And as her brother, I will protect her for as long as her path doesn&#39;t cross mine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut if ever the time comes that &hellip; that she embraces what she really was and turns her back to the Cainhorn Castle and the people who served her, I will personally see to her demise. That &hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is the limit of my honor. And my responsibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __X<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) there are three types of nobility, the &#39;Crowned&#39; nobles, the &#39;Commoner&#39; noble and the &#39;Fief&#39; nobles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong them, the commoner nobles are the most common type of nobles as &#39;any man with a land greater than 10 acres and with an annual income of more than 500 Silvers can be called a commoner noble.&#39; They do not have any particular difference between a commoner peasant except their economic power and in times of war, they are as useless as any other peasant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next comes the &#39;fief&#39; nobles or nobles who have been granted land on lease by a higher authority like a King or an Emperor. This is the most common form of nobility and they are the lowest rung of people who are entitled to the Noble&#39;s Penal Code of Etiquette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese nobles have to pay a certain amount of money to their masters as a guarantee for safety and their status as a noble. Cainhorn Castle and the Dean household falls in this category. The nobility title of these nobles is not inheritable but by making constant &#39;donations&#39; to the right people, one can &#39;extend&#39; their term even after the death of the actual recipient of the title.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt last, there is the &#39;crowned&#39; nobility. These nobles aren&#39;t bound to any rulers, instead the rulers are bound to these nobles. These nobles pledge allegiance to the ruler, whether it be a King or an Emperor, during their inception ceremony and stay loyal to kingdom or empire. But on certain conditions, their allegiance can go null and they can all compete for the throne of the ruler. This is called the Succession War.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe minimum requirement to become a crowned noble is by entering the ranks of a Lord.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*I will make another auxiliary chapter dealing with all the strange aspects of the noble lifestyle later*</p>', 0, 2234, 1, '2021-04-25 08:25:33', '2021-04-25 08:25:33');

Infront of him, Felix stood silently, intently gazing at the three ships docked at the Cainshire docks and the hundreds of soldiers pouring out of the ship like ants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe place where they were standing was like a protrusion from the Castle Cainhorn and they could view the entire Cainshire lake and the entire Cainshire from there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; They are doing it again&hellip;&quot; Felix murmured under his breath, his emotions on the point of overflowing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAslak sighed to himself and stepped forward. Placing his hand softly over his shoulder, he comforted his brother, &quot;Please, Felix. Don&#39;t do this to yourself. You know, you can&#39;t help them. Unless&hellip;&quot; his voice trailed off into an uncertain note.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Unless what?&quot; Felix asked, turning back and looking at him with his pale blue eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip;&quot; Aslak tried to speak but he couldn&#39;t. His face had a pained expression and he turned away after a few moments. &quot;&hellip; Leave it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelixyon pursed his lips and didn&#39;t say anything. He knew what his brother wanted to tell. Overthrow Lady Faye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverthrow his mother.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverthrow the one person in this world whom he considers his most-precious. The one person who gave life to him. To turn back on her&hellip; was that possible?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s start practice. We don&#39;t want to worry Demon Loann.&quot; Aslak said as he picked up a sword from the arsenal beside him and threw Felix one. Felixyon caught the sword and looked at it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCold steel&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis heart pained for the first few seconds but then&mdash;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Lookout!!!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAslak made a sudden move and dashed towards Felix with an uncanny agility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Woah!&quot; Felix cried as he parried the strike but Aslak smirked and shouted, &quot;Beginner&#39;s luck, bro!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;!&quot; Felix looked astonished the first second but then anger flushed on his face, &quot;You&#39;re the f*ckin&#39; beginner!!&quot; he yelled and dashed forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix and Aslak&#39;s training went for a full 6 hours before stopping. It was already dusk and coldness was beginning to seep through their thick skin into their bones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Fue! Let&#39;s stop it for today. Aslak, how much till you reach the Stage-8 of the Seeker Stage?&quot; Felix asked, sheathing the sword in the scabbard. He helped Aslak move the arsenal of weapons back into the smithy which was placed at the edge of the courtyard, the same smithy which was once used by Master Smith Torgeir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hmm&hellip; let&#39;s see, considering the timing and everything &hellip; I would say two weeks or more&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Too damn long!!&quot; Felix muttered, a little frustrated. He, himself, was currently in the Stage-9 of the Seeker stage and all he needed was a big push to the Lord realm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&#39;When I become a Lord, I will inherit my father&#39;s mantle and turn Cainhorn into a crowned territory&hellip;&#39; Felix clenched his fist on that prospect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Central Continent, there are manly three types of nobility and the Dean family fell into the second type, the fief nobles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFief nobles, unlike crowned or commoner nobles, were entitled to all the facilities of the Noble&#39;s Penal Code of Etiquette and to all other facilities of nobility but they needed to pay a required amount of tribute to the ruler after every period of time and also, their titles are not hereditary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, if Felix needed to lead his own forces, he needs to fulfill certain criterions, like becoming a Lord.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut reaching the realm of Lord from Stage-9 Seeker is very hard, harder than anything one can imagine and Felix was understanding that every moment. It&#39;s been nearly two months since he entered the Stage-9 and since then, he has never had a single breakthrough. He was getting impatient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hmmm&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight as they were doing their simple chores, Aslak noticed a figure behind them, staring intently. He glanced back and a bright smile surfaced on his face. Felix noticed that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Why are you smiling?&quot; he asked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Seems like you&#39;ve a visitor, brother.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;?&quot; Felix turned around and like Aslak said, there was indeed someone staring at them intently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHiding behind the white pillars of the courtyard, stood a small figure wearing a long white skirt and a woolen sweater.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Erika?!&quot; he cried out instantaneously but the moment he did, the girl dashed away from the pillar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Here! Hold this.&quot; Felix threw his sword towards Aslak and dashed towards Erika, himself, leaving Aslak to do the chore himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What the f*ck!!!!!&quot; he cursed aloud.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix followed his sister through the corridors of the Castle and finally caught her near the kitchen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going, chicken!&quot; he asked her, a small smile forming on his lips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe girl infront of him was his sister, his own sister. Erika. She was a girl of 4 and was nearly half the size of Felix. She had skinny arms, large crimson eyes, flowing white hair and a face so similar to him. She had his smile of innocence, eyes full of intelligence which was quite uncommon for her age and she giggled by showing a large row of white teeth. Just like how he did when his father joked. When he was still there&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe rubbed her head lovingly and asked in a tender voice, &quot;Did you sleep well, girl? Or did you stay awake and played with those dolls your sister made for you, eh?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I don&#39;t play with dolls!! I&#39;m big!!&quot; She pouted cutely but all she managed to get was a laugh. But then, all of a sudden, her enthusiasm dwindled and she huffed her shoulders tiredly. Felix noticed it and knew at once that she was sad. He picked her up in his arms and looked closely at her crimson eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Chicken, What&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; Jasmine don&#39;t want to play with me anymore&hellip;&quot; she pouted sadly. Felix smiled ruefully and replied, &quot;You know, she has to study. Mother Yasmina is strict with her.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Puuu!! I hate her! She always takes my candies saying that my teeth will decay! Why don&#39;t all her teeth fall off!!! Puuuu!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What she says is true.&quot; He smiled. &quot;And did you ask sister Asha and Arv to play with you?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I did but Asha was busy beating Arv so she couldn&#39;t play with me!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Is that so?! Then, why don&#39;t we go and join in the fun!&quot; he said, teasingly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Mhmmm&hellip;&quot; she nodded her head timidly. This time, Felix frown deepened. He knew his sister more than anyone. She was lithe and delightful and not many things make her sad. Infact, when the subject of beating and harassing Arv comes, she is the first one to pitch in beside Asha. Many things make her angry but not sad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What is it, Erika? What is it that you&#39;re not telling me?&quot; Felix asked, seriously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I&hellip; saw mother&hellip;&quot; she muttered ever so silently but her words rung like bell in his ears.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What?!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You did what?!!&quot; Felix cried, furious. His mood taking a 180-degrees turn and his brows furrowed at a terrible angle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErika, as if knowing that it would anger her brother, shut her mouth and didn&#39;t even let out a peep but it was far from able to keep her brother&#39;s prying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Did I not tell you girl, to not disturb mother? She&#39;s weak and she needs rest. Why did you go to her?!&quot; he asked, in a patient yet angry tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe pouted and turned her head away. &quot;I &hellip;only wanted to see her.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix loved both her mother and sister dearly but there was something he couldn&#39;t tolerate at all and that was having them together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis mother was a pure Catholic and something as blasphemous as searing some criminal&#39;s child was intolerable to her, even though, it was done to only benefit her. Her already half-insane mind pushed herself to the brink and she started to torture herself, not eating, taking medicines and whatnot. It was horrible to see someone whom he once loved with his life turn into this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then there was Erika. He hated her for his mother&#39;s condition but not for long. Maybe, it was his mother&#39;s wish for a girl that stopped him or his father&#39;s advise that even people not related by blood can be blood brothers or sisters. And he hoped that she could heal her mother. Only she couldn&#39;t. Infact, she worsened it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer mother was critical to Erika ever since her birth. Not touching her, not loving her, not even feeding her. Felix was fine with it. Time would heal, he thought. but then came the verbal abuse. She would something cuddle Erika but not because she loved her, no, because she wanted to curse at her. Curse the sleeping Erika for hours at length and finally came the physical abuse when she tried to choke the girl to death. And that became the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix banished his own mother from her quarters to a much farther, darker and more solitary quarter in the back of the Castle and to Erika, he restricted her from visiting her mother. He even appointed a dozen veteran guards to stand guard at the corridor where his mother stayed to protect her from anything that might harm her but even then, Erika was able to reach her. Just like this time. Or so he thought.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;How did you get to mother&#39;s chambers? I specifically asked the guards to look for intruders from the chimneys and windows. How did you get there?&quot; he asked, his anger diminishing and in its place, a tiny bit of interest arose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe pouted a little and answered, innocently, &quot;Hmph! What do you think, eh, that I haven&#39;t noticed those little traps you laid for me!! Hmph! I&#39;m smarter than that, big brother!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled faintly but his questionnaire persisted, &quot;Tell me, Erika. How did you reach mother&#39;s chambers?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErika glanced at his eyes and found them to be dead serious. So, she bit her lips and replied in a timid tone, &quot;&hellip; I didn&#39;t&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Really? Then where did you meet her? You aren&#39;t lying to me to intentionally make me angry, are you, girl?&quot; he asked, bringing her face closer to his.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;No!!!&quot; she rebutted furiously, &quot;I do not lie! I met her on the hallway! She was going somewhere with those old monkeys!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Old monkeys?! You mean the old men of the Council of Advisors? What are they doing with mother!?&quot; a deep frown plastered over his face but Erika frivolously shrugged her shoulders and said, pouting, &quot;Maybe they all went for ice-cream!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix wasn&#39;t entertained by this tasteless joke. He took her and headed towards the children quarters where he kept her on the watch of Lady Aarti before heading towards his own room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __X</p>', 0, 2234, 1, '2021-04-25 08:25:55', '2021-04-25 08:25:55'),
(16161, 'First Kill', 'Chapter 4', 'chapter-4', '<h2>4 Ch &ndash; 02 First Kill</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way to his chambers, he met Mallus and his personal guards. He frowned because Mallus arrival only meant that the worst incident was happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sire, we have a problem.&quot; Mallus said in a grave tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMallus was a young man of 18, only a few years older than Felix himself, with a head full of blonde hair and wore a full plate Warden knight armor. Along with him there was a batch of twenty armored warriors, all young and between the age of 13 and 22. They were all wearing black Warden knight armor and were Felix&#39;s personal guard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It&#39;s mother, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Felix asked in a calm tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire. Lady Faye and the Council of Advisors are meeting in fifteen minutes with the spokesperson of Colonel Reggie. I think they are going to con milady Faye again.&quot; he spoke, perspiring a little.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hmmmm&hellip;&quot; Felix nodded his head, calmly, without replying, his initial worry and anger diminishing so quickly that Mallus felt a chilly vibe coming from him. He beckoned at Mallus and said, &quot;Come inside.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire.&quot; Mallus obliged. Both of them entered Felix&#39;s chambers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix&#39;s chamber was a very simple room with the least amount of decorations. The room was filled with cupboards and bookshelves filled with books, a big oakwood table, an elegant chair and a large mirror adorned one side of the room along with two mannequins. The mirror was the gift from Lady Faye to Felix on his tenth birthday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mannequins contained two sets of armor. One was the Royal Warden&#39;s armor with a large, crimson cape and the other was a full metal, black armor, given to him by Master Smith Torgeir before departing from Cainshire. The Royal Warden suit of armor was given to him as a condolence gift from Sir Celyn Prothero, the Grandmaster of Order of the Wardens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second armor, though, was a parting gift from Master Torgeir, who left the Cainhorn region after his beloved was killed by the soldiers of the Varshney regiment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe sighed once when he looked at that armor because all he felt from that armor was sadness and guilt. It was called the Black Etheryne Armor because of its similarity with the Etheryne Armor of the Elves, a full metal, tight-fitting armor with sharp edges. The only difference between this armor and the Etheryne Armor is that this armor had its Pauldrons shaped like wolfs, or wolf pauldrons and<br />\r\n<br />\r\na Sallet helmet. It also had a scaled inner armor rather than mail armor and was made with Grade-3 steel, a very high quality steel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe took the Black Etheryne Armor and slowly wore it, down to up. He wore the greaves, sabatons and poleyns first. But when it came to the Breastplate, he sat down heavily on the chair and said in a calm voice, &quot;Mallus, help me.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire!&quot; Mallus obliged immediately and helped Felix to wear the Breastplate. Soon, the leather strips were tightened, the clasp were attached and Backplate followed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Mallus, listen carefully.&quot; Felix said to Mallus, all of a sudden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Go to Percy and tell him that I ordered him to get his men ready. I also want him to mobilize Kyle&#39;s Myr Squad, Venus Squad and Milan&#39;s Thunder squad to guard the Main gates and get the Jadeite Guards ready at the moment&#39;s notice. Also, send your most trusted messenger to Aslak and tell him to ready his archers, especially Stryker and his squad.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; Sire, can I know what your thoughts are?&quot; he asked without looking up. He tapped his shoulders and said in almost a whisper, &quot;Sire, your arms.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix obliged and spread his arms wide. Mallus took the Vambrace, Rerebrace and the pauldrons from the rack and helped Felix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; To do what I should&#39;ve done three years ago&hellip;&quot; Felix muttered, extremely calm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; I see&hellip;&quot; he replies as he sighed to himself. Mallus stepped back after completing his task. Felix moved his arms a bit to test his flexibility and was satisfied. He attached the cape and it came down, flowing magnificently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Tell me, Mallus. Do you swear your loyalty to me? To the Castle of Cainhorn and to the people of the Cainshire? Do you swear to protect the name of the Dean household and stand up to all the injustices it had faced in the past 5 years? Will you stand by my side?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire. I will!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThum!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe said as he thumped his Breastplate. It was the standard knight salute to a higher-ranking knight. Felix grinned a little and said, &quot;Will you raise your sword against the old and wicked for corrupting the minds of the lords and ladies of Cainhorn?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip;&quot; Mallus gulped frightened by then he again thumped his chest and said, &quot;I will, for you, Sire, I will.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Good.&quot; He smiled, &quot;Then let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix headed straight towards the Throne Room where all the official meets and gatherings take place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Throne Room was a magnificent hall made with clear, white marbles, tall pillars as wide as the width of tree and the ceiling of the Throne Room was made with clear, tinted glass. Through these glass, red, green and blue light seep through and give a magical feel to the entire hall. Along with that, the Throne Room had three entrances, the main entrance and two side entrances for the maids, servants and the household.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe entered the Throne Room and found it packed to the brim with old men of the Cainhorn and Cainshire. Among the most influential were, Sir Peder Ruen, the Garrison Commander, Sir Loann, the Commander of the whole Cainhorn army, Sir Doncan, the Keep doctor, his mother, Lady Faye and Lady Yasmina, the 2nd mistress of his father.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the minor figure, there was Kadec, the treasurer, Illec the Keep librarian, Chester and his family, the head butler and caretaker of the Dean household. There were many other old men who were discussing among them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd lastly, there was Munroe, Colonel Reggie&#39;s personal spokesperson and the person for whom the 2-year contract became a 5-year contract.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt seems like Felix was a little late. By the time he reached, it seemed like a general consensus had already been reached. The old men were nodding their heads in unison, Sir Peder and Sir Loann had a pained expression on their faces, Lady Yasmina wore a complete black outfit but even then, a deep coldness was seeping out which was even felt by Felix. As for Munroe, he had a big smug on his face.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&#39;It must&#39;ve been something to do with Mother Yasmina&hellip;&#39; Felix drew a conclusion. He pushed his way through the crowd when his curiosity was finally answered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;So, let us draw the conclusion of this meet. Lord Colonel Reggie, on the behalf of Lord Hendrickson, will pay the Lady of Cainhorn 100,000 Golds on exchange of 5 additional years on the Cainshire Verdict and &hellip;.&quot; His licked his lips lustfully, &quot;And in exchange of the body of Lady Yasmina of the land of Yasmin. Everybody who agrees, say &#39;Aye&#39;!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;AYE!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;AYE!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;AYE!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;NAY!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe shouts of the old men were disrupted by a single &#39;nay.&#39; Everyone looked a bit shocked and looking around, they found, Felix standing with his hands on his waist. He wore the magnificent, Black Etheryne Armor with a bright crimson cape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe stepped out of the crowd and smiled profoundly at Munroe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Making a decision without my consent! Aren&#39;t all of you getting a little ahead of yourself.&quot; He smiled at the old men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe moment Munroe saw who it was, his facial expressions worsened for Felix was his archnemesis. After all, if Felix wasn&#39;t there, he would&#39;ve already been able to wrench the Cainhorn Castle out of the hands of the Dean family. For 5 years, Munroe bribed several members of the Council of Advisor and to garner support in the Council. His objective was to destroy the Dean lineage and successfully transfer the throne of Cainhorn from the hands of Lady Faye to Colonel Reggie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Step aside, child. This is not a place for you or your idiocy.&quot; Munroe snarled through his teeth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Really? If I&#39;m a child, as you say, then why is your Varshney soldiers conscripting children younger than me in your armies. To fight wars. And as I know, men who can fight wars have equal rights as any. So, Munroe, my friend, why should I not participate in such a &hellip; important meeting?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You!!&quot; a few veins surfaced on his face and in anger, he turned towards Lady Faye and yelled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Lady Faye! What kind of manners are these? How can you let your child sway the decision of the council of advisor when he isn&#39;t even of age? I seek justice!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yay!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sire, step away.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Do as instructed, little Lord!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCries rung out from the several dozens of old men and frankly, it angered Felix but he didn&#39;t let it show. He turned towards his mother and saw her uninterested, like always. Ever since she came back, she had been like that, distraught and uninterested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe looked up and said faintly, &quot;Child &hellip; leave&hellip;&quot; her voice contained a tinge of pain and suffering and it also pained Felix to see his once-cheerful mother like this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe sighed and turned his back towards her. A pallor of coldness spread over his face and he yelled in a strong voice, &quot;Boys!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBam!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBam!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBam!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the three doors were bashed open and one by one, soldiers clad in armor entered the room. The people in the room were instantly thrown in disarray as murmurs and gossips flew around the room like bees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeeing the soldiers enter, Munroe&#39;s heart fluttered in shock and anxiety. He looked here and there but all her saw was red and black knights enter the room, everyone filled with a tinge of murderous aura. This was bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled lightly and walked towards Munroe in slow steps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMunroe noticed Felix and pulled out his dagger and pointed it at Felix. &quot;What do you plan on doing, evil child?!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip;&quot; Felix didn&#39;t reply. He only kept walking with a smile on his face, a smile so bright that it was entering the ranks of evil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Don&#39;t come near o-or else I will&mdash;I will kill myself and shame the Dean household. Stand away!!&quot; he yelled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled and raised his hands in defeat. &quot;I won&#39;t&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Lookout!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFwooosh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs soon as someone shouted, an arrow glowing with a blue glow darted towards Munroe and almost instantly, a dark shadow replaced Felix as he dashed forward, his hands swooping in like the talons of an eagle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You!&quot; Munroe cried in anger as silvery-white light glowed around his body. In a split moment he dodged the arrow but that only threw him directly into the hands of Felix. He punched with his hand straight up, in hopes of giving Felix an uppercut but it failed terribly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix parried it exceptionally and soon his hands clasped Munroe&#39;s hand tightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe smiled evilly and said, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t compare yourself with me, friend.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;AAAAHHHHHH!!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA bloodcurdling scream rung out as Munroe&#39;s hand was twisted 360 degrees, breaking his bones, tendons and ligaments completely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;AAHH!! HELP! PLEASE!! AAHHH!! IT HURTS! HURTS!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe pleaded miserably but Felix didn&#39;t even glance at him, instead he looked at everyone in the room and said faintly, &quot;&hellip; This is what happens when commoners try to measure themselves to nobility&hellip; When they try to act powerful infront of us, nobles&hellip; this is the outcome, wise men of the council&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShiiiiing!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe pulled his Longsword from his scabbard and placed it near Munroe&#39;s neck. Sneering, he said, &quot;Moron!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;NOO&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlash!!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThud!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __X</p>', 0, 2234, 1, '2021-04-25 08:26:22', '2021-04-25 08:26:22'),
(16162, '5 The Sword of Patricide and Madness', 'Chương 5', 'chuong-5', '<h2>5 The Sword of Patricide and Madness</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Thud&hellip; thud&hellip; thud&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was a pin-drop silence in the throne as the severed head of Munroe rolled down from his body and hit the ground thrice before stopping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPssst!! Psssssst!!! Pssstttt!!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlood erupted from the severed area like a fountain and spread all over the floor and Felix&#39;s armor, but he stood frozen like a statue. Finally, when the spurting of blood stopped, he moved. The first thing he did was relax his grip on the dead body and let it drop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe body fell on the floor lifelessly with an additional thud.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix looked at his palms for a few moments, realizing that it was his first kill&hellip;. And frankly, he enjoyed. It was a completely different feeling when killing a human than killing a beast and Felix enjoyed it beyond explanation and deep inside him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe felt more amazed than shocked or terrified or elated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe only glanced at the blood smeared onto his armor and cape and tried to rub it away but it only left a smear. A bloody smear on a black armor, almost invisible but there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA sigh escaped his lips and he resumed his action, almost normally. He sheathes his Longsword back into the scabbard and look up to find two men, nearly of same age, standing a few paces away from him, staring with absolute loyalty. Behind them, were two dozen more knights, clad fully and wholly and ready to serve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Mallus. Percy.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThump! Thump!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo thumps clearly reverberated through the Throne Room, waking everyone up from their stupor. The old men of the council of advisors looked horrified, Sir Loann and Peder had an amazed yet shocked whereas Lady Yasmina and Faye looked completely baffled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLady Faye stood up weakly from her seat and said in a stuttering voice, &quot;S-s-son, w-what have you done&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled lightly and said the same words which he said to Mallus 15 minutes ago, &quot;&hellip;Something which I should&#39;ve done 3 years ago&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;W-wha&mdash;why?&quot; she asked, her voice tearing up but Felix didn&#39;t reply immediately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe turned towards two of his personal guards and said in a calm tone, &quot;Sylvie, Rose, take Lady Faye back into her chambers and tell the guards there to increase their vigilance.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire!!&quot; both of the female lady knight thumped their chest and proceeded towards Lady Faye. They took her by her hand and slowly escorted her back to her chambers. Lady Faye looked back a few times, tears in her eyes, but Felix didn&#39;t even glance back at her. It saddened her more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Close the doors!&quot; he ordered, right after his mother left the Throne Room, throwing the room full of old men into panic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sire, w-what are you doing?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Young Sire, please don&#39;t frighten us old men like this?!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sire, please don&#39;t stay quiet like this.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sire, we are merely advisors! Have mercy on us!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe old men pleaded Felix lovingly, like they always did but this time, Felix was unmoved. His face was as cold as ice and it wasn&#39;t hard not to get frighten by that. Even veterans like Sir Peder and his captains were having their heart flutter and beat madly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAslak walked towards Felix in his Silver armor, garnering the attention of all the men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe had an irritated expression on his face and he grumbled to Felix, &quot;Damn! You stole my kill, Felix!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix shook his head and replied, &quot;He&#39;s a human, Aslak not a monster. There&#39;s no kill-steal here.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe shrugged his shoulder and handed a long list to Felix. Felix looked at the list and found it too long. He frowned and asked, &quot;Is there such a need?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Afraid so, brother.&quot; Aslak replied with a smile. He then headed back towards the western door and stood with his archers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Must be their lucky day to get on your good side. Bastards!!&quot; he cursed before looking at the crowd with renewed anger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The names in this look step aside from the crowd.&quot; He announced loudly and no sooner did he do so, murmurs escaped the lips of the old men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;QUIET!!&quot; he commanded in an angry tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Lady Yasmina.&quot; He announced coldly and looked at her, &quot;Step aside.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLady Yasmina is the 2nd mistress of late Sir Aston and was also a Princess of a distant kingdom and even though, such behavior didn&#39;t quite please her she didn&#39;t question Felix. She clasped her dress and moved aside before asking Felix in a wronged voice, &quot;Why are you doing this, Felix?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Because I have to, mother.&quot; Felix replied calmly before looking away. He looked at the list again and announced a number of names in one breath. &quot;Sir Peder Ruen, Garrison Commander, Sir Loann, Commander of the Cainhorn army, Sir Doncan, Keep doctor, Sir Illec, Keep librarian, Sir Donovich LeCarter, Chester Bourgeoise, Madam Bourgeoise, &hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter announcing a mere dozen names more, all of whom were veterans who once served the Cainhorn army and the captains of the army, Felix stopped. He looked up and saw all of them standing erect behind whose name had been called.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe turned back towards the council of advisors and looked evilly at them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;For the crimes of corruption, bribery and influencing Lady Faye in making wrong decision which gravely harmed not only the people of Cainshire but also the name of the Cainhorn Castle, I, Felix Dean, the son and heir of late Sir Aston Dean, proclaim all of you as traitors. Punishment &ndash; Execution.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What!! No!!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You cannot do that!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Blasphemous!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCries and curses flew across the room like pebbles but Felix and his men looked stonecold. They were more than happy to kill these people as they were nothing but leeches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix turned towards Kadec, the perpetrator who started the whole pro-Hendrickson feelings. Standing infront of him, Felix said coldly, &quot;Kadec, do you wish to confess your crime? If you do, I will lessen your statement. Will you?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Kadec did not. He looked angrily and disgustedly at him and said, &quot;You will never be able to snuff out the flames of freedom, Young Sire! Never! Hendrickson will restore Cainshire and Cainhorn to glory and you cannot do anything to stop it! Never!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;KNEEL!!!&quot; Felix commanded but Kadec stood majestically, garnering faith and praises from his fellowmen but the veterans only sneered at his idiocy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix turned towards Mallus and commanded him in a grave tone, &quot;Mallus!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire!&quot; replied Mallus loyally but he understood Felix&#39;s command.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe walked briskly towards Kadec and clutched his shoulders tightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Don&#39;t you&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA great force pushed Kadec onto the ground, his knees bending to the utmost. &quot;Stay quiet!!&quot; Mallus bellowed at him. He turned towards Felix, his face telling him a hundred emotions but Felix&#39;s face was as hard as a rock. His brows furrowed and a deep voice escaped Felix&#39;s throat. &quot;Do it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGulp&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMallus gulped in terror. He clutched his sword at his side but couldn&#39;t pull it out. It was not that it was too heavy but his emotions were. Kadec was like a father to Mallus and after the death of his parents, it was he who took him in, fed him and clothed him. It was even Kadec who introduced Mallus to Felix from where he became the Captain of Felix&#39;s personal guard. In short, it was Kadec who gave Mallus everything he has now but now, his idol, his mentor, his best friend and his Lord was asking him to kill Kadec. How was he able to do that?!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd this fact was understood very well by Kadec. He smiled crookedly and announced in a victorious tone, &quot;He can&#39;t, Sire. Neither can anyone else. Can&#39;t you see it clearly enough, Felix! All of the men you trained were our sons, our daughters! In short, our blood and flesh! You may eradicate us as vices but remember! Since you proclaim us as vices then your own men will be nothing less than a vice!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPatricide! Young Lord! Patricide! Do you even know what the church will do if they find out&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Shut up!!&mdash;Bam!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA flurry of punches wreaked Kadec&#39;s face. Felix looked angrily at Mallus and growled at him, &quot;Do it&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMallus gulped his tasteless saliva down countless times and his muscles tensed to the point that veins were visible but he was still couldn&#39;t pull the sword out. It was too heavy!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKadec smiled through his bloodied face and announced, &quot;He can&#39;t. And he won&#39;t. The sword he uses, was also given by me. He will not kill with that sword, Sire. He will not.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Is that so?&quot; Felix asked him in a cold tone. &quot;Very well.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe clutched his own scabbard and tore it from his side. He extended the hilt of the sheathed sword towards Mallus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Can you do it now?&quot; he asked, calmly but coldly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip; Sire&hellip;&quot; Mallus cried in a tearful voice but Felix&#39;s looks stopped him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled at him and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mallus. It will be alright. Do not think of it as patricide because it is not your sword that does the killing. Not by your hand. But by my sword and my hand. Let my sword be the Sword of Patricide and Madness.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip;Sire&quot; his voice teared up more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Let me be the vessel of your madness and your demons. I will gladly accept it for the vengeance I seek for my men, my people and the injustices they faced in these 5 years of my life.&quot; Felix smiled brightly at Mallus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It is a small price to pay, Mallus. Really small.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sniff! Sniff! Yes, milord!&quot; Mallus said after a moment. He clutched Felix&#39;s sword from his hand and announced grandly, &quot;I will become the sword that cleanses evil from the face of this Earth! I shall purge evil, milord, with all my heart and zeal and will serve you with the last of my breath. Hyah!!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Nooo&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlash!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThud&hellip; thud&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike thunder streaking across the sky, the Sword of Patricide and Murder fell down like a heavenly blow, severing Kadec&#39;s head from his body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Huff&hellip;. Huff&hellip;. Huff&hellip;.&quot; Mallus heaved up and down tensely, frozen in the stance in which he slayed. A small smile surfaced on Felix&#39;s face. He walked towards him and took the sword from his hand and muttered silently in his ear, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&hellip;what&hellip;&quot; Mallus cried, unsure. Why was his Lord Felix thanking him? He only did his job and nothing else, so why was he thanking him? Why? Was patricide something to be thankful of? Why?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis thoughts run amok and even though there was a slight anger in his heart towards Felix but he snuffed it out. Felix never explained himself because he never completed his sentence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&#39;Thank you for standing by my side, Mallus.&#39;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix&#39;s heart craved in sadness. He was a knight too. He trained as a knight and he knows his oaths. Patricide&hellip; he made one of his best friends break a commandment of the oath of knighthood and that means he broke two of the commandments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPatricide and Un-willed force.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe needs to repent for that and he will but he doesn&#39;t feel remorse or regret.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalking towards Percy, he handed the same sword to him and said in a cold tone, &quot;Do your deed, Percy. Uphold the virtues of knighthood.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, Sire!&quot; Percy said, without question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPercy was the leader of the second squadron under Felix&#39;s direct command, the Jadeite squadron containing 15 knights like him, including him, and 3 squires for each knight, a total of 60 men. Other than him, there was Venus squadron leader, Venus leading a force of 7 female knights and 23 female squires, making her squadron one of the most peculiar of all. Other than them, there was Mallus leading Felix&#39;s personal guards of 25 knights and Aslak leading a mighty force of 150 archers, out of which there was 30 knights. But other than the four of them, there was also Kyle and Milan, the only two soldiers in Felix&#39;s Castle Guards who were older than 26 and they led the Myr Squad and the Thunder Squad respectively. All under the direct command of Felix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPercy was the most chivalrous leader of all the six. He was only twenty-three and was nearly 7 feet tall with broad shoulders, dark brown hair and hazel eyes. His face was not clean like Mallus and was always dirty, ragged and square but it all contributed to his masculinity as he was the most-favored and hotly debated man among the girls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was orphan who was brought up by his uncle, just like Mallus but unlike him, his uncle treated him harshly and all of his current achievement had no contribution of any of his family members. As such, he did not have a single inclination of thankfulness towards them or his will of letting them live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe brandished the sword and walked briskly towards his uncle, who was also a part of the council of advisors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;No! Son! No! Don&#39;t do this!!&quot; his uncle screamed at the top of his tongues and made a dash for the exit but it was all futile. Percy caught up to him in no time and straight it went through the old man&#39;s torso.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Kugh! Kah!!&quot; he spurted mouthful of blood a few times before the life in his eyes dimmed down. Dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpliiickk!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe pulled the sword out of his back and handed it back to Felix. Felix smiled at him and said, &quot;Thank you, Percy, for standing by my side.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPercy kneeled down and said, aloud, &quot;My life and my will is all yours, milord!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelix smiled before patting his shoulders. &quot;Stand up, Percy. Friends don&#39;t kneel to each other.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking at others, he said, &quot;Come forward those who have the mettle in their hearts to vanquish evil and restore the purity of this room. Stand up, my knights for the justice you and your family in Cainshire deserves!!! For the oaths you took when you started your knighthood! For the evil that perturbs the sanctity of this Throne Room. Stand up and walk forward!!!!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe held the sword by its blade and pointed the hilt towards the other knights. One by one, the knights under him marched forward, took his blade and then a life. And thus, the first flame of revolt and slaughter sparked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __X</p>', 1, 2234, 1, '2021-04-25 08:26:45', '2021-04-25 08:26:45');

The only SSR card that I got was a Two-faced Buddha that accumulated from card pieces, I have never once gotten a Bird Sister or a Goldfinger before&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to play this game anymore!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLin Huang was expressionless. He had been playing Master XX for half a year, after obtaining tens of thousands of amulets, he had never gotten an SSR card; not even an SR card Bird Sister or a Goldfinger. He only managed to get those by accumulating card pieces so he did not have any hope for the 10 card draw. He had completely given up on the game since he got the nickname and began losing in battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe placed his finger on the game, took a deep breath and deleted the game. Just when he was about to keep his phone in his pocket, he felt a vibration. He then looked at the screen. It was completely black with a gold-colored sentence in the middle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Would you like to travel through dimensions?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was only one option at the bottom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt seemed like an online game commercial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes, my a*s!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince he had just deleted the Master XX game, Lin Huang did not have the mood to download any new games. He tapped on the home button on his phone. Just as he attempted to keep his phone in his pocket, his phone vibrated again. He took a look at his phone, it was the same page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Stop it! This mobile game is like some online game with endless pop-up commercials, who would want to play such game?&quot; He frowned and closed the page. Just as he wanted to keep his phone, the same page popped up again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Could this be a virus?&quot; Lin Huang frowned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was in love with his iFruit7 smartphone that he just bought. He spent one entire month&#39;s salary to get it after all. He restarted his phone and looked at the screen for a while. The page did not pop up again, he was relieved. When he picked up his phone, his phone vibrated and the page popped up again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Would you like to travel through dimensions?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was only one option at the bottom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;F*ck, this is not going away!&quot; Lin Huang was furious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Since I&rsquo;m getting it fixed later, I shall see this what kind of stupid game this is and I will report you!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter some hesitation, Lin Huang pressed &lsquo;yes&rsquo; on the screen. As he tapped &#39;yes&#39;, the screen began changing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Dear respectable dimensional-travel candidate, thank you for accepting our request. Please read the terms and conditions carefully. If you agree, please click &lsquo;accept&rsquo; and you will officially be a dimensional-traveler. After obtaining your travel code, we&#39;ll send you a Goldfinger and transfer you to another world. Enjoy!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe words appeared for about 20 seconds before the terms and conditions appeared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;1. The current death rate of travelers are as high as 73%, please prepare yourself before your travel. Causes of deaths are as below:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuicide - Death rate: 48%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeath through battle - Death rate: 33%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNatural death - Death rate: 10%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAssassinated - Death rate: 6%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFailed to activate Goldfinger - Death rate: 2%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBad luck - Death rate: 1%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLin Huang only glanced at the first few pages as there were 118 pages to the terms and conditions. He was too lazy to read the entire thing so he scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the &lsquo;accept&rsquo; button.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Respectable candidate, you are now officially a dimensional-traveler. Your traveler code would be 142857. Entering Goldfinger page&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe screen changed again, there was a spinner of 36 columns on the screen. Each column was the same size and there was a golden question mark on each of them with a pointer pointing in the 12 o&rsquo;clock direction. There were two buttons at the bottom of the spinner, one was &lsquo;start&rsquo; while the other was &lsquo;stop&rsquo;. There was also a description of the rules beneath the buttons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Press &lsquo;start&rsquo; and the pointer will start to spin, press &lsquo;stop&rsquo; to stop the pointer. The item that the pointer stops at will be your Goldfinger. If you did not press the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button, the pointer will stop automatically one minute after the spin had begun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Until now, they have yet to show me the name of the game. Let me know what game is this!&quot; Lin Huang pressed &lsquo;start&rsquo; and the spinner started spinning fast. A few moments, he pressed the &lsquo;stop&rsquo; button. After gliding for a while, the pointer stopped at one of the question marks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt then became a black card and the spinner disappeared. The card was enlarged and occupied the entire screen. Lin Huang raised his eyebrow, the card was nicely designed with metallic black and gold patterns on the edges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Not a bad card design&hellip;&quot; Lin Huang complimented. However, as he thought of the Master XX game that he spent half a year playing, he became upset again as it was also a card game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile he was immersed in his thoughts, a black glow shot out of his phone into his forehead. Lin Huang did not notice it at all as he looked at the screen of his phone that began changing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Goldfinger has been sent, now randomly picking an initial world for this travel&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Am I finally getting into the game?&quot; Lin Huang smirked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;As soon as I see the name of the game, I&#39;ll take a screenshot and report this stupid game!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon, the screen on his phone changed again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The initial world that was randomly picked is &lsquo;Monster Paradise&rsquo;.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Traveller 142857, enjoy your trip!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Pop!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis gold iFruit7 phone dropped on the floor. The screen was destroyed, Lin Huang disappeared from where he was&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Traveller&rsquo;s Serial Number: 142857&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Name: Lin Huang&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Gender: Male&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Age Before Traveling: 25 years old&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Age After Travelling: 15 years old&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Initial World: Monster Paradise&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Travelling Identity Setting: Lin Huang, Male, 15. His 13-year-old sister is the only family member he has left in the world. Born with a broken Life Wheel, his lifespan is 10 times shorter than ordinary people.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Remaining Lifespan: 91 days.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Memory Integration: 98%&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Number of Travels: 1&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Goldfinger Status: Deactivated&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking at the semi-transparent page, Lin Huang was slightly startled. He could not recall how many times he had looked at that very page this week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt had been a week since Lin Huang traveled to this world and became a 15-year-old juvenile. He was outstanding, bagging first place among the fresh graduates at the Hunter Reserve College where he obtained a full score for almost all his papers. However, he had one fatal setback - his broken Life Wheel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was a crack in the Life Wheel which looked like a gray stone in his body. It was almost broken in half. Among the 360 Life Light columns, only three were lit and the third one was quite dim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo ordinary people, these columns would represent three years of life but as his lifespan loss was 10 times faster, Lin Huang was left with only three months to live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I look better now, perhaps the only thing I can be happy about.&quot; Lin Huang threw his head back as he laughed at himself in front of the mirror.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe had black, puffy short hair with eyes that were dark and intense. Lin Huang had nice features. Despite that, within a split second, he tightened his fists and frowned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What&rsquo;s the use of looking good? Although the Goldfinger that you promised to give me before I began to travel is with me, at least send me a manual on how to use it. It has already been a week and I still have absolutely no idea on how I can activate Xiao Hei...&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXiao Hei was the Goldfinger that Lin Huang randomly selected before he time traveled. It was a black card and he had tried every possible way he could to activate it but failed. He had no idea what the function of that card was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I&rsquo;m back, brother!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust as Lin Huang pointed the mirror, playing the blame game, he heard the voice of a girl from behind the door. The door closed shortly after and he figured that the girl must have entered the password and entered the house.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe then shut the semi-transparent page before him and took stock of his emotions before walking down the stairs. He lived in a small double-story penthouse where both bedrooms were on the second floor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe arrived at the ground floor and smiled at the girl who was changing her shoes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe girl seemed like a 13-year-old with short, black hair with a length slightly below her earlobes. Her bangs covered her eyebrows entirely and her eyes were bright and naive. She wore a printed white t-shirt, a pair of faded blue jeans and white sneakers. In all honesty, her clothing made her resemble a boy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Xin Er, you&rsquo;re back! Wash your hands, we&rsquo;re having dinner soon.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey sat across each other at the table. While they were eating, Lin Huang&rsquo;s left pinky started to tingle. Soon, a semi-transparent video was projected in front of him. The same thing happened to Lin Xin! Her eyes popped when she saw her ring projecting a video.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ring was given to everyone after they received their birth certificate. It contained information that included a personal identity account, and a small space for storage. It was also the only tool connected to the Heart Network. Projections like these were rare and if something like this ever happened, it usually meant something big had happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hmm?&quot; Lin Huang stopped eating and stared at the projection. Lin Xin found it strange as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was a middle-aged man with a serious expression in the video. Lin Huang recognized him, he was the news reporter from No.7 Safety Zone, quite the popular dude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Breaking news! Somebody found a new Virtual Eye 310 kilometers southeast from No.7D101. There&rsquo;s a high possibility of a monster invasion. Those who reside in that area, please be aware. Do not leave the foothold, stay indoors tonight.&quot; Find authorized novels in Webnovel，faster updates, better experience，Please click www.webnovel.com for visiting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter watching the video, Lin Huang frowned as the area number, No.7D101 was the official code of Wulin Town, his home!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the area size, Wulin Town was categorized into four grades A, B, C and D which respectively represented an area size that was large, medium, small and a core size, which was the smallest. The number 7 before the letter D was the safety code while number 101 at the back was the foothold&rsquo;s code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Virtual Eye mentioned in the video was the portal that the monsters opened to invade the human world. It was named the Virtual Eye because it looked like a semi-transparent giant pupil that protruded towards the sky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Brother, the virtual eye is so near to our home, would monsters come to the foothold?&quot; Lin Xin asked worriedly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Now that the news is out, the Monster Hunters would&rsquo;ve received the news as well. In fact, they&rsquo;d get the news earlier than when we did. There&rsquo;s also a defensive shield at the foothold which cannot be broken so easily.&quot; Lin Huang assured both him and Lin Xin and then exclaimed joyously, &quot;Let&rsquo;s eat!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter dinner, Lin Xin went back to her room to get started on her homework while Lin Huang washed the dishes. The sky was getting darker. Lin Huang returned to his room and looked at the Heart Network&rsquo;s page to check for updates regarding the Virtual Eye. On the Heart Network, ongoing news about the Virtual Eye was being broadcasted continuously after they received the alarming notification during their meals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The Hunters have arrived at foothold No.7D101, close to the Virtual Eye to hunt down the monsters.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Silver Hunter Li Lang appeared near foothold No.7D101!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Silver Hunter Li Lang led 18 hunters to hunt down the monsters.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;After more than an hour of hunting and killing, all monsters iron-level and above within 100 kilometers of No.7D101 were destroyed. More hunters joined the hunter troop to continue with the mission within that area.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLin Huang was relieved when he read the news. He sounded so sure when he was comforting Lin Xin but in reality, he was not sure at all. After all, he had just arrived into this world for a month and it was his very first time encountering a Virtual Eye. But from what he read on the Heart Network, there were no threatening monsters from that Virtual Eye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe time and location a Virtual Eye would open were completely random. The number and level of monsters cannot be predetermined. If the number or the level of monsters were too high, they would definitely be able to kill more than 10 hunters, including the Gold Hunters. The defensive shield in a small foothold like Wulin Town would be insignificant, like paper glue when faced with a massive crowd of monsters. It would be hopeless and useless to try stopping those monsters then.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Lin Huang&rsquo;s first week since his arrival in this world, although he did not figure out how to activate his Goldfinger, he somehow figured out what kind of world he was in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were many history channels that spoke of monster attacks on the Heart Network. Lin Huang was taken aback the first time he saw it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat he thought was unforgettable was the ruins of a huge foothold. He remembered each and every detail of the video recording.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA giant bloody pupil was opened in the void and countless monsters charged out of it. Within seconds, they broke through the defensive shield of the big foothold. That day, almost a billion people were killed by millions of monsters within a few hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe foothold was covered in blood with dead bodies floating on the sea of blood while monsters feasted on their remains&hellip;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe foothold that Lin Huang was located in was just a D-grade foothold. This small town had a small population of fewer than 100,000 people. Such a foothold was the least secured within the safety zone. If this foothold was attacked by a strong monster, everyone would perish even before any hunter could even arrive to rescue them. Fortunately, the opening of this Virtual Eye only released small monsters and hunters were able to kill them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLin Huang fell into deep thought after closing the Heart Network.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;From the speed of lifespan lost earlier, I&rsquo;m only left with 91 days to live. The most important question right now was... How do I get the Life Crystals to replenish my Life Light? I have no idea how to activate Goldfinger so I best leave it aside. Life Crystals are up for purchase on the Heart Network but it&rsquo;s too expensive. The minimum purchase, a year&rsquo;s worth of Life Crystals costs 100,000 credit points. I don&#39;t even have 30,000 in savings!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife Crystals were a unique item that barely dropped from hunting monsters. There is a massive amount of Life Light in each crystal. It must be chewed in the mouths and the Life Light in the crystals will then enter the Life Wheel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The fastest way to get Life Crystals is by hunting monsters and selling the materials on the monsters&rsquo; bodies. It&rsquo;s certainty that there would be Life Crystals achievable from the hunt. However, with my ability now which isn&rsquo;t even at iron-level, the kind of monsters I&rsquo;m able to fight are worthless&hellip; Worry not for I shall try my luck outside the foothold. Perhaps there would be at least one Life Crystal. I shall get ready tomorrow and head out the day after!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was late at night; Lin Huang stared at the dark sky from his window. After a short while, he emptied his mind and went to bed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the middle of the night, a noise that sounded like glass breaking woke him up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Ahh&hellip;!!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust as Lin Huang woke up, he heard a girl scream in his blurred state. The scream came from close by and he could tell; it was his sister, Lin Xin&rsquo;s voice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe jumped down of his bed and dashed to Lin Xin&rsquo;s room. He did not even have the time to change; he was still in his pajamas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe flung the door open.</p>', 0, 2236, 1, '2021-04-25 08:30:37', '2021-04-25 08:31:47'),
(16164, 'A sickness in the head', 'Chapter 1', 'chapter-1', '<h1>1 A sickness in the head</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In the chaotic darkness, the young Ren Xiaosu awoke and started wiping off the sweat on his forehead. Then he looked towards the boy of around 14 who was standing at the door.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Liuyuan, did anything happen?&quot; Ren Xiaosu asked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAddressed as Liuyuan, the boy&#39;s full name was Yan Liuyuan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom his appearance, Yan Liuyuan looked like a very harmless and innocent person. However, he was holding a bone knife in his hands and standing guard at the door. It was deep into the night at the moment, but he did not close his eyes even though he looked very sleepy, as he had to keep watch through the night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYan Liuyuan shook his head and said, &quot;No, everything is fine. Hmm, what exactly is this sickness you&#39;re experiencing in your head? Even the town&#39;s doctor can&#39;t diagnose what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about such things. What I&#39;m experiencing is not a sickness.&quot; Ren Xiaosu said firmly, &quot;It&#39;ll be dawn soon, and I&#39;ll be going out to hunt. You should sleep for a while so that you can get up in time for school.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;OK.&quot; Yan Liuyuan nodded, glum. &quot;But what&#39;s the point of studying in a wasteland like this&hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It will be useful for you in the future,&quot; Ren Xiaosu said in an irrefutable tone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I want to go out to hunt too.&quot; Yan Liuyuan pouted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Who&#39;s going to keep watch at night if something happens to you? Me, who&#39;s unconscious?&quot; Ren Xiaosu stood up and prepared to go fetch water from the town center as it was less dangerous to do so after dawn broke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the night, it was a lawless land out there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&hellip;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDark clouds were building up without rest in the cloudy sky. A drop of acid rain eventually fell from above. It got blown about by the strong winds and finally landed in front of Ren Xiaosu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu was lying on the ground in the wilderness. He frowned and felt that he was a little unlucky today as the acid rain arrived before his prey appeared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomeone mentioned that he must be careful of the beasts while moving around in this wasteland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Ren Xiaosu felt that the person left everything else unspoken, because many things could still kill a person out in this wasteland. One of them was the acid rain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Ren Xiaosu still did not make a move. If he couldn&#39;t catch some game today, he and Yan Liuyuan would starve to death before they could die from the disease caused by the acid rain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu&#39;s eyes popped when he heard a bird&#39;s wings flapping. However, the rhythm of his breathing did not change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu had used a tree branch to prop up a black cauldron and scattered some black bread crumbs underneath it a short distance ahead of himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat large bird landed beside the cauldron and looked around sharply with an alert gaze. The size of the bird was not that much smaller than the cauldron, in fact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs it stood in the same spot preening its feathers, Ren Xiaosu did not make a move and continued waiting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bird finally seemed to let its guard down as it started sneaking towards the cauldron as a thief would.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, when it entered into the boundary under the cauldron and was about to lower its head to peck on the bread crumbs, Ren Xiaosu pulled hard on the rope in his hand. Right after, the young man jumped up and rushed towards the cauldron like an unbridled wild donkey. Before the large bird could flip the cauldron over, he mustered all of his strength and used his body to pin down the cauldron!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Phew!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu heaved a sigh of relief as he had waited an entire night just to catch this sparrow. Fortunately, his efforts had not gone to waste today, especially since such good opportunities were hard to come by.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClattering came from inside the cauldron as the struggling sparrow battered its tough wings against it. At this moment, the short melody of the bell striking the hour rang from the refugee stronghold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu turned around and looked at the town. He wondered when he could finally bring Yan Liuyuan to live inside the stronghold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo Ren Xiaosu, the people living in the stronghold were fortunate because they did not have to face the dangers of the wastelands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, not just anyone could enter that place as they wished.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight at this moment, the activity in the cauldron quieted by a lot. He let out a sigh and checked if the ragged cloth was wrapped firmly around his hand. Then Ren Xiaosu slowly lifted the cauldron up to create a tiny opening and put his hand in. He attempted to grab hold of the large sparrow by its legs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, life was not always that smooth sailing. Ren Xiaosu yelped right after putting his hand under the cauldron.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu pulled out his hand and had a look at his palm. The web between his thumb and forefinger was bleeding, as not even the ragged cloth could protect it against the sparrow&#39;s sharp beak.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu got angry. He removed his ragged jacket and wrapped it around his hand. Then he thrust his hand under the cauldron again and grabbed the sparrow by its neck this time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe took the sparrow out from under the cauldron and tucked it in his arm. With a strong twist of his hand, the sparrow&#39;s neck broke and it went limp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this moment, Ren Xiaosu felt a pinch in his heart because the large sparrow&#39;s claws had punched several holes into his jacket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuddenly, his mind went blank, and Ren Xiaosu fell to his knees. It was as if a massive copper bell had been struck inside his head. Then he descended into a chaotic darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOh no! In the past, this sickness only occurred at midnight, but now it came earlier?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was not the first time his sickness had &quot;acted up.&quot; Almost all the people in town knew there was something wrong with his head, and his pain would flare up at random times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnly Ren Xiaosu knew that it was not pain but a state of confusion that he was experiencing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWait a minute. This time, it was different from the past. The black mist in his mind had dispersed and revealed a &quot;palace&quot; beyond it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu&#39;s eyes flew open, and he stood up. He looked at himself in disbelief. &quot;I came to this quickly?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe originally had a chance to get a closer look at the palace&#39;s appearance, but he knew better. There was no difference between remaining unconscious and dying out here in the wilderness. Right now, he had to rush back to the town that was situated outside of Stronghold 113 before the heavens opened up with the acid rain!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu tied the sparrow&#39;s legs together and slung it over his shoulder. Then he lifted the big cauldron and inverted it onto his head before running away. Pitter-patter. Raindrops started falling on the cauldron.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cauldron had turned into his umbrella.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore he could run far, however, the silhouette of a person holding a bone knife stood in his way. &quot;Give your catch to me&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut before the person could finish his sentence, he saw a big cauldron swinging in closer and closer, until it smacked into his face!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Damn!&quot; The robber fell backwards. He had not expected Ren Xiaosu&#39;s attack to be that swift! And it was so forceful too!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen he saw Ren Xiaosu lower the pot before swinging it back up and placing it over his head to use as an umbrella, all in a single, continuous motion&hellip;. The robber had not even fallen to the ground, yet Ren Xiaosu was already running off into the distance!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber laid on the ground facing the sky as the acid rain came down. It was a little painful and stung his face. There was something about this that he could not understand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn most situations, shouldn&#39;t there be some interaction between them? Just how many times had this young man encountered a similar situation to react so instinctively!?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomething was not right. He could hear that young man&#39;s footsteps approaching again!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber hurriedly sat up and turned around to look. He discovered that the young man was coming back to him!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu had not planned to return, but he distinctly heard a voice reverberate from the palace in his mind, &quot;Quest: Gift your catch to someone else.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho said that? Ren Xiaosu turned around and walked back to the robber with some uncertainty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber said in panic, &quot;Let&#39;s talk this over&hellip;. Hey, that&#39;s not right, I&#39;m the victim here&hellip;.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu sized up the robber. He noticed that there were no others nearby.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You want this sparrow?&quot; Ren Xiaosu asked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;I do!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Here, take it.&quot; Ren Xiaosu stuffed the sparrow into the man&#39;s arms without explaining himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat unfamiliar yet neutral voice intoned again, &quot;Quest complete. Awarded: Basic Skill Duplication Scroll. You may use it to learn another person&#39;s skills.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRen Xiaosu was stunned, because he could feel a leather parchment appear within his mind!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Skill Duplication Scroll that he could use to copy another&#39;s skills? Like hunting? Survival? Or some other skill?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber hugged the large sparrow tightly in his arms and began to express his gratitude. &quot;You&#39;re a good person&mdash;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore he could finish speaking, he saw Ren Xiaosu grab the sparrow back before leaving again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe robber was confused.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe stared at Ren Xiaosu&#39;s receding figure as he scurried away&hellip;. The fuck is this guy! What is he after?</p>', 0, 2235, 1, '2021-04-25 08:31:31', '2021-04-25 08:31:31');
